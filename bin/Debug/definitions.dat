ArrayArrayLinearÈA linear array, often referred to as a one-dimensional array, stands out as a foundational data structure. It serves as a systematic arrangement of components, all sharing a common data type, and residing in end-to-end memory slots. Binary Search TreeTree
Non-Linear´A binary search tree is a binary tree where each node in the left subtree is less than the root, and every node in the right subtree is of a value greater than the root. The properties of a binary search tree are recursive: if we consider any node as a ‚Äúroot,‚Äù these properties will remain true.GraphGraphs
Non-Linear‘In the graph theory within mathematics, a graph data structure covers a limited collection of vertices. It also includes a set of unordered pairs for undirected graphs or ordered pairs for directed graphs. This structure is employed to represent the concepts of undirected and directed graphs in both theoretical and practical applications.
Hash TableHash
Non-Linear≤In the field of data structures, a hash table is a mechanism that embodies the abstract data type of an associative array. This type of structure facilitates the mapping of keys to corresponding values. Utilizing a hash function, the hash table calculates an index (referred to as a hash code), directing it to a specific location in an array of buckets or slots. The desired value can then be retrieved from this identified location.HeapTree
Non-LinearòA heap is the completed version of a binary tree that meets the heap property.  For each node, the value of its children is less than or equal to its own value. Heaps are used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.Linked listListLinearæA linked list is used to store sequences of components.  Each component within the linked list is referred to as a node, and for every node in list is referred to the next node within list. ListListLinearöA list, in the context of abstract data types, is a set of numbers in ordered values, where the same value can appear more than once. Lists are fundamental containers, capable of holding other values. When identical values are present, each occurrence is treated as a separate item.QueueAbstractLinearÒA queue is a grouping of entities arranged in a sequential order. This arrangement allows for the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the opposite end, thereby enabling modifications to the queue.Self-Balance TreeTree
Non-Linear∆A self-balancing tree is any node-based binary search tree that automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions.SetAbstract
Non-LinearäA set serves as an abstract data type capable of storing different values without following to a specific order. Essentially, it represents a computational manifestation of the mathematical idea of a limited set. Unlike various other data structures, the typical operation with sets involves checking whether a value is a member of the set, rather than explicitly retrieving a specific element.StackAbstractLinearŸA stack functions as a grouping of elements, featuring two primary operations: Push, which appends an element to the collection, and Pop, which eliminates the most recently added element that has not yet been removed.Two Dimension ArrayArrayLinearÕA multidimensional array refers to a data structure capable of storing information across multiple dimensions, enabling the arrangement of data in a grid-like format. This arrangement proves valuable for showing complex data relationships and conducting operations on data that fundamentally align with a multi-dimensional framework.
